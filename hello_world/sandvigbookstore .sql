For the rest of us,  however, SQL is a first-class nuisance that we do our best to avoid by  relying on relatively user-friendly--but usually less powerful--tools. <em>SQL Queries for Mere Mortals</em> aims to bring SQL-phobes  closer to the first camp by tutoring them carefully in what SQL can do.<p> The authors recognize that SQL queries usually come about as a result  of questions from human beings, and so usefully spend a fair bit of  time showing how to convert, say, &quot;In what cities do our customers  live?&quot; into, &quot;Select city from the customers table&quot; and, finally,  &quot;SELECT city FROM customers&quot; in SQL. They call this the &quot;translation  and clean up&quot; process, and it\'s a fine approach. They don\'t press it  too far, however, and are equally adept at presenting straight  explanations of SQL syntax elements in prose. They spend a lot of  energy graphically diagramming aspects of SQL syntax in a format that  requires some up-front study. A particular reader might prefer text  capsules to this arrow-intensive format, but other learners might like  the graphical syntax diagrams. <em>--David Wall</em></p>', '54.99', 'Addison-Wesley Professional', 'August 21, 2000', '1', '528'),

Anyone with a modest knowledge of HTML and web site  management can learn to create dynamic content through the PHP  programming language and the MySQL database. This book gives you the  background and tools to do the job safely and reliably. <em>Web Database Applications with PHP and MySQL</em>,  Second Edition thoroughly reflects the needs of real-world  applications. It goes into detail on such practical issues as  validating input (do you know what a proper credit card number looks  like?), logging in users, and using templates to give your dynamic web  pages a standard look. But this book goes even further. It shows how  JavaScript and PHP can be used in tandem to make a user\'s experience  faster and more pleasant. It shows the correct way to handle errors in  user input so that a site looks professional. It introduces the vast  collection of powerful tools available in the PEAR repository and shows  how to use some of the most popular tools. Even while it serves as an  introduction to new programmers, the book does not omit critical tasks  that web sites require. For instance, every site that allows updates  must handle the possibility of multiple users accessing data at the  same time. This book explains how to solve the problem in detail with  locking. Through a sophisticated sample application--Hugh and Dave\'s  Wine Store--all the important techniques of dynamic content are  introduced. Good design is emphasized, such as dividing logic from  presentation. The book introduces PHP 5 and MySQL 4.1 features, while  providing techniques that can be used on older versions of the software  that are still in widespread use. This new edition has been redesigned  around the rich offerings of PEAR. Several of these, including the  Template package and the database-independent query API, are fully  integrated into examples and thoroughly described in the text. Topics  include:</p><ul>  <li>Installation and configuration of Apache, MySQL, and PHP on Unix&reg;, Windows&reg;, and Mac OS&reg; X systems</li>  <li>Introductions to PHP, SQL, and MySQL administration</li>  <li>Session management, including the use of a custom database for improved efficiency</li>  <li>User input validation, security, and authentication</li>  <li>The PEAR repository, plus details on the use of PEAR DB and Template classes</li>  <li>Production of PDF reports</li></ul>', '44.95', 'O\'Reilly Media', 'May 16, 2004', '2', '680'),

('0672326728', 'PHP & MySQL Web Development', '<p>The PHP server-side scripting language and the MySQL database  management system (DBMS) make a potent pair. Both are open-source  products--free of charge for most purposes--remarkably strong, and  capable of handling all but the most enormous transaction loads. Both  are supported by large, skilled, and enthusiastic communities of  architects, programmers, and designers. <em>PHP and MySQL Web Development</em> introduces readers (who are assumed to have little or no experience  with the title subjects) to PHP and MySQL for the purpose of creating  dynamic Internet sites. It teaches the same skills as introductory  Active Server Pages (ASP) and ColdFusion books--technologies that  address the same niche.</p><p> Authors Luke Welling and Laura Thomson\'s  technique aims to get readers going on their own projects as soon as  possible. They present easily digestible sections on specific technical  processes--&quot;Accessing array contents&quot; and &quot;Using encryption with PHP&quot;  are two examples. Each section centers on a sample program that strips  the task at hand down to its essentials, enabling the reader to fit the  process into his or her own solutions as required. Tables that list  options and other nuggets of reference material appear as well, but the  many examples and the authors\' commentary on them take center stage.</p><p> For reference material on MySQL, have a look at Paul DuBois\'s <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735709211/$%7B0%7D\">MySQL</a></em>.
